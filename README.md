This is my personal [dev container](https://containers.dev/) for developing Node.js applications. It is based on Ubuntu LTS.

In order to use this:

1. Add it to your repo via [git-subrepo](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo):
   `git subrepo clone git@github.com:a1russell/node-app-devcontainer.git .devcontainer`
2. Share your git credentials with the dev container by following instructions in the linked documentation:
    * [Sharing Git credentials with your container](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/sharing-git-credentials)
    * [Key-based authentication in OpenSSH for Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement)
3. For VS Code, follow
   [Getting Started](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_getting-started) and
   [Quick start: Open an existing folder in a container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container).
